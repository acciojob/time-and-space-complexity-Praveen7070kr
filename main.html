	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<P>Time complexity is a measure of how long it takes to run an algorithm, and is usually written as T(n), where \(n\) is a variable related to the size of the input.</P>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>is often expressed using big O notation, similar to time complexity. For example, a function that takes O(n) time will also take O(n) space</p>
